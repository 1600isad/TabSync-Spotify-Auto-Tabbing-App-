# 🎸 TabSync — Spotify Guitar Tab App

*Currently OpenAI API calls are not working on demo due to me only having a free plan which doesnt allow for the calls to work, it does work though locally
Live website demo link: https://web-production-e301ab.up.railway.app/

## How It Works

Log in with your Spotify account
Play any song on Spotify
TabSync detects what's playing and automatically fetches a Songsterr tab link and generates an AI chord chart for the song
Use the AI tools to rate the song's difficulty, get a gear/tone breakdown, or get practice tips
Chat with the AI assistant to ask questions about the tab, chords, or technique

## Tech Stack

Python + Flask — backend server and routing
Spotipy — Spotify API integration for real-time now playing detection
OpenAI GPT — AI chord chart generation and guitar assistant features
Songsterr — tab search integration
HTML/CSS/JavaScript — frontend UI with dark mode
